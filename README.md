Please update your code to call from the csv file here!

The README.md instruction file, .gitignore, along with the final report will be stored in github, by themselves. 

The makefile and .yaml for parameters will be stored in a github file (report tools)

***Both /code and /output folders have dummy files so I could push them... ignore!***

- Please store Rscripts in /code folder

- Please use the following naming convention for your Rscripts:
        analysis_initials.R
          So, a regression model done by Amaka would be regression_am.R
          
- Please store .rds in /output folder
          
- Please use the following naming convention for your .rds files:
        analysis_out_initials.R
          So, Amaka's regression output is saved as regression_out_am.rds
