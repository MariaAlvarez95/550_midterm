The README.md instruction file along with the final report will be stored in github, by themselves. 

The makefile, .gitignore, and .yaml for parameters will be stored in a github file (report tools)

***Both /code and /output folders have dummy files so I could push them... ignore!***

- Please store Rscripts in /code folder

- Please use the following naming convention for your Rscripts:
        analysis_initials.R
          So, a regression model done by Amaka would be regression_am.R
          
- Please store .rds in /output folder
          
- Please use the following naming convention for your .rds files:
        analysis_out_initials.R
          So, Amaka's regression output is saved as regression_out_am.rds
